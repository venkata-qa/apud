## 1. Opportunity

- Establish a modular, shift-left QA model where both frontend (React Native mobile/web) and backend (Java microservices) teams validate their components before integration.
- Introduce robust Functional Testing at all levels â€” including unit, UI flows, and API behavior â€” integrated into CI pipelines.
- Embed a full spectrum of Non-Functional Testing (NFT) including:
  - âœ… Accessibility (e.g., axe-core, Lighthouse)
  - âœ… Performance (bundle size, API latency, render speed)
  - âœ… Risk-based testing (FMEA)
  - âœ… Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT)
- Integrate all testing into CI/CD pipelines to enforce pre-merge and pre-release quality gates.
- Implement dashboards for test outcomes, NFT metrics, and release readiness.
- Deliver OTA-ready, business-configurable modules through validated, decoupled releases.

## 2. Modular Engineering Landscape

| Stream            | Details                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend          | React Native (mobile/native + web); modular components (e.g., Booking). Shell app (demo only); not yet automated. Azure DevOps CI. |
| Backend           | Java microservices; GitHub/GCP CI; supports modular UI via REST APIs.   |
| Integration Layer | Occurs after FE/BE validation; API handshake + flow composition.        |
| Final Delivery    | My Bupa app renders validated modules in business-configured flows.     |

|----------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shell App            | Not used for validation         | Automate shell app tests in CI.                                   |
| Contract Testing     | Informal                        | Standardize and gate via CI with Pact (or equivalent).            |
| Accessibility        | Not automated                   | Add CI hooks for axe-core, Lighthouse, RN Inspector.              |
| Performance          | Not measured                    | Integrate k6, Lighthouse for baseline checks.                     |
| Test Ownership       | Unclear                         | Define lifecycle test ownership per squad.                        |
| Integration Failures | Late stage                      | Validate upstream, shift left with contracts + dashboards.        |
| Test Data            | Inconsistent                    | Standardize and automate in CI.                                   |
| Observability        | No unified view                 | Build dashboards for test, coverage, and OAT compliance.          |
