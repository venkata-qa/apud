## 1. Opportunity

- Establish a modular, shift-left QA model where both frontend (React Native mobile/web) and backend (Java microservices) teams independently validate their components before integration.
- Introduce robust Functional Testing at all levels â€” including unit, UI flows, and API behavior â€” integrated into CI pipelines.
- Embed a full spectrum of Non-Functional Testing (NFT) including:
  - âœ… Accessibility (axe-core, Lighthouse, RN Inspector)
  - âœ… Performance (bundle size, API latency, render speed)
  - âœ… Risk-based testing (FMEA)
  - âœ… Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT) to ensure production readiness
- Implement live dashboards for test outcomes, NFT metrics, and release readiness.
- Deliver OTA-ready, business-configurable modules through pre-integrated validation and automation.

## 2. Modular Engineering Landscape

| Stream           | Details                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend         | React Native (mobile/native + web); modular components (e.g., Booking)  
|                  | Packaged as NPM modules; pipelines in Azure DevOps  
|                  | Shell app exists (demo-only); not used for automated validation  
| Backend          | Java microservices; GitHub/GCP CI; support modular UI via REST APIs  
| Integration Layer| Occurs after FE/BE validation; API handshake + business flow assembly  
| Final Delivery   | My Bupa app renders assembled flows from validated modules

## 4. Current Gaps & Interventions

| Area                 | Gap                            | Recommended Intervention                                            |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Shell App            | Not used for testing            | Automate shell app tests for RN components pre-publish              |
| Contract Testing     | Missing or inconsistent         | Standardize Pact usage and enforce as CI gate                       |
| Accessibility        | No checks in CI                 | Introduce axe-core + Lighthouse with severity thresholds            |
| Performance          | No baseline or tracking         | Track bundle size, render latency, API perf with k6/Lighthouse      |
| Risk Testing (FMEA)  | Not practiced                   | Embed FMEA in planning; trace risks to validation/OAT steps         |
| Test Ownership       | Undefined                       | Assign test layers clearly across squads and lifecycle stages       |
| Test Data Management | Inconsistent, partially manual  | See Section 9                                                       |
| CI Observability     | No unified view                 | Build cross-squad QA dashboards for coverage, contracts, OAT        |

## 5. QA Ownership Model

| Stream   | Owned Test Types                                          | Exit Criteria Before Integration                                      |

## 9. Test Data Management â€“ Strategy & Approach

### Why It Matters

Inconsistent, manual test data setup leads to flaky tests, CI bottlenecks, and high maintenance cost.

### Goals

- Build consistent, reusable datasets for all test types  
- Automate provisioning for unit, UI, contract, and perf testing  
- Support environment tagging, scenario scoping, and teardown handling

### Approach

| Aspect               | Strategy                                                             |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Design          | Reusable templates per module (e.g., Booking, MSS)                  |
| Tagging & Scoping    | Metadata like `@env=QA`, `@type=negative` for test orchestration    |
| Provisioning         | Setup via fixtures, preseed APIs, or CI setup scripts               |
| Environment Strategy | Use env-specific prefixes/namespacing to isolate data               |
| Cleanup              | TTL datasets, post-test deletion, or ephemeral environments         |
| Versioning           | Store scripts/templates in GitHub per squad                         |
